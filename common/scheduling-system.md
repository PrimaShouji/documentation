# Scheduling System

Prima has not just one, but two scheduling systems: Announce and Schedule.

## Announce

Announce is used for nearly all schedulable content - Delubrum Reginae, Zadnor, Bozja, and social events. It's integrated with Google Calendar, so you can view upcoming events in your calendar application of choice.

### Announcing events



### Saving community calendars

All calendar links end with a time zone written in their URLs, usually at their end. You can recognize the time zone in a URL by the text `ctz=` immediately preceding it.

Google Calendar uses time zone names as defined by the [tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_database\_time\_zones). To adjust how events are displayed, replace `America/Los_Angeles` with the appropriate label from the **TZ database name** column of the table on the linked Wikipedia page.

You can add a community calendar to your own Google Calendar using the **+ Google Calendar** button at the bottom-right of the webpage.

Clicking this button will take you to your own Google Calendar and give you an option to add the community calendar to your own calendar set.

If you would like to then save a calendar to an external application, click the settings button under the **Other calendars** section of the interface.

From here, scroll down to the **Integrate calendar** section and copy the text under **Public address in iCal format**. Refer to your calendar application's documentation to use this address to finish integrating the calendar.
